# Create a simple Rust console app

## Setting up the development environment

1. Install Rust: You can download the Rust toolchain from the official [website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Install a text editor or IDE: Rust works well with many popular text editors such as VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim. Choose the one you're most comfortable with.
3. Create a new project: Open up a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Type the following command to create a new Rust project:

    ```javascript
    cargo new myapp
    ```

    This command will create a new directory called myapp with a `Cargo.toml` file and a `src` directory containing a `main.rs` file.

## Writing the code

1. Open `main.rs` in your text editor and write the code to prompt the user with questions and store their answers. Here is an example of how you can prompt the user for input and store it in a variable:

    ```rust
    use std::io;

    fn main() {
        // Prompt the user for input
        println!("What is your name?");
        let mut name = String::new();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut name).expect("Failed to read input");

        // Store the user's input in a variable
        let name = name.trim();

        // Display the user's input
        println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    }
    ```

2. Add more questions and prompts as needed to collect all the necessary information from the user.
3. Once you have all the information, generate the complete prompt and either display it on the command prompt using `println!()` or write it to a file using the appropriate file input/output functions in Rust.

## Running the application

1. To run the application, open up a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your Cargo.toml file is located.
2. Type the following command to compile and run the application:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

3. Follow the prompts and provide your answers to the questions.

## Distributing the application

- To distribute the application, you can host the code on a Git repository such as GitHub.
- Provide instructions on how to clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies. You can include a `README.md` file to help users get started with the application.
